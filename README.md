# LS3D-uResourceLoader-
Importer resources from LS3D Engine in Unity3D (4.x - 5.x)

WARNING! This loader only works with - Mafia: The City of Lost Heaven. A lot of bugs and flaws.
Currently there are only loading geometry (from *.4DS) and textures (from *.BMP). Meshes have the wrong location.

Development stopped completely. This source code is only for the explore.
